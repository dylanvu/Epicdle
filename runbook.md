# Audio is wrong date/missing

1. Make debug API request to the daily reset route with a payload body of the **day that is broken**

- For example, if the audio for 11/14/2025 is missing, make the request with the payload body of `2025-11-14`

2. Create a message telling users to play it in incognito mode

# Purging the CDN cache

I don't know how to do this yet... so just make an update telling users to play it in incognito mode..
